Hi! I'm Cameron, a junior at Cornell University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am 
interested in systems and networking, particularly operating systems. I'm also passionate about computer science's applications in spaceflight.

At Cornell, I am a member of the [Cornell Rocketry Team](https://www.cornellrocketryteam.com/). I'm also working on flight software for [Alpha CubeSat](https://alphacubesat.cornell.edu/), a project within Cornell's Space Systems Design Studio. Previously, I was the flight software lead for the [Cislunar Explorers CubeSat](https://www.spacecraftresearch.com/cislunar-explorers-fe), another project in the SSDS.

In my free time, I enjoy developing modern and efficient apps for macOS. I'm also interested in vintage computing, baseball, and movies.
